Determination of convex hull with a genetic algorithm
=====================================================

In this tutorial we will determine the convex hull of a binary alloy slab. The convex hull can be used to check whether a certain composition is stable or it will decompose into mixed phases of the neighboring stable compositions. We will use a (111) slab to represent a close packed surface, the method can easily be extended for use in other systems, e.g. bulk, nanoparticle, ... We choose a rather small atomic structure with 24 atoms in the unit cell, in a binary system the number of different atomic distributions for a single composition is determined by the binomial coefficient :math:`\frac{N!}{n_A!n_B!}`, where :math:`N` is the total number of atoms in the slab, :math:`n_A` and :math:`n_B` is the number of A and B atoms respectively. This number rises combinatorially towards the 1:1 composition and in total there exists 16.8 million different atomic distributions for the 24 atom slab (without taking symmetry into account which will reduce the number significantly see :ref:`symmetry`). A number of this size warrants a search method other than brute force, here we use a genetic algorithm (GA).

Outline of the GA run
---------------------

The GA implementation is divided into several classes, this means that the user can pick and choose specific classes and functions to use for the optimization problem at hand. If no ready-made crossover operator works for a specific problem it should be quite straightforward to customize an existing one.

We will create an initial population of (111) slabs each with a random composition and distribution of atoms.

The candidates are evaluated with the :mod:`EMT potential <ase.calculators.emt>`. To make comparisons between different compositions we define the mixing or excess energy by:

.. math:: E_\text{mixing} = E_{AB} - \frac{E_A \cdot n_A}{N} - \frac{E_B \cdot n_B}{N}
          
where :math:`E_\text{AB}` is the energy of the mixed slab, :math:`E_A` and :math:`E_B` are the energies of the pure A and B slabs respectively.

We will take advantage of the :class:`ase.ga.population.RankFitnessPopulation`, that allows us to optimize a full composition range at once. It works by grouping candidates according to a variable (composition in this case) and then ranking candidates within each group. This means that the fittest candidate in each group is given equal fitness and has the same probability for being selected for procreation. This means that the entire convex hull is mapped out contrary to just the candidates with lowest mixing energies. This "all in one" approach is more efficient than running each composition individually since the chemical ordering is similar for different compositions.

We will use the typical operators adjusted to work on slabs: ``CutSpliceSlabCrossover`` cuts two slabs in a random plane and put halves from different original slabs (parents) together to form a new slab (offspring). This Deaven and Ho style crossover is able to refine the population by passing on favorable traits from parents to offspring. ``RandomSlabPermutation`` permutes two atoms of different type in the slab keeping the same composition. ``RandomCompositionMutation`` changes the composition of the slab.

In :ref:`customization` we look at ways to customize the way in which the algorithm runs in order to make it more efficient.

Initial population
==================

We choose a population size large enough so that the entire composition range will be represented in the population. The pure slabs are set up using experimental lattice constants, and for the mixed slabs we use Vegard's law (interpolation). :download:`ga_convex_start.py`

.. literalinclude:: ga_convex_start.py
                    
Now we have the file :file:`hull.db`, that can be examined like a regular :mod:`ase.db` database. The first row is special as it contains the parameters we have chosen to save (population size, reference energies,  etc.). The rest of the rows are candidates marked with ``relaxed=0`` for not evaluated, ``queued=1`` for a candidate submitted for evaluation using a queueing system on a computer cluster and ``relaxed=1`` for evaluated candidates.
                    
Run the algorithm
=================

With the database properly initiated we are ready to start the GA. Below is a short example with a few procreation operators that works on slabs, and the ``RankFitnessPopulation`` described earlier. A full generation of new candidates are evaluated before they are added to the population, this is more efficient when using a fast method for evaluation. :download:`ga_convex_run.py`

.. literalinclude:: ga_convex_run.py

We can evaluate the results of the algorithm continuously while the database is being updated. We use the :class:`ase.phasediagram.PhaseDiagram` to plot the convex hull. In the script below we retrieve the evaluated candidates and plot the convex hull. We also write a trajectory file with all the candidates that make up the convex hull. :download:`plot_convex_hull.py`
                    
.. literalinclude:: plot_convex_hull.py
                    
All evaluated structures are put in the plot, if the number of points is disturbing the plot try to put ``only_plot_simplices=True`` instead of ``only_label_simplices=True``.
                    
We then view the structures on the convex hull by doing (on the command-line)::

    $ ase gui hull.traj

Customization of the algorithm
------------------------------

So far we have a working algorithm but it is quite naive, let us make some extensions for increasing efficiency.

Exact duplicate identification
==============================

Evaluating identical candidates is a risk when they are created by the operators, so in order not to waste computational resources it is important to implement a check for whether an identical calculation has been performed.

The list of elements in the candidate determines the structure completely, thus we can use that as a measure to see if an identical candidate has been evaluated::

      for _ in range(pop_size):
        dup = True
        while dup:
            # Select parents for a new candidate
            parents = pop.get_two_candidates()

            # Select an operator and use it
            op = operation_selector.get_operator()
            offspring, desc = op.get_new_individual(parents)
            # An operator could return None if an offspring cannot be formed
            # by the chosen parents
            if offspring is None:
                continue

            atoms_string = ''.join(offspring.get_chemical_symbols())
            dup = db.is_duplicate(atoms_string=atoms_string)

.. _symmetry:
            
Symmetric duplicate identification
==================================

Having identical or very similar in the population will limit the diversity and cause premature convergence of the GA. We will try to prevent that by detecting if two structures are not identical in positions but instead symmetrically identical. For this we need a metric with which to characterize a structure, a symmetry tolerant fingerprint. There are many ways to achieve this and we will use a very simple average number of nearest neighbors, defined as:

.. math:: \text{NN}_\text{avg} = [\frac{\#\text{Cu-Cu}}{N_{\text{Cu}}} , \frac{\#\text{Cu-Pt}}{N_{\text{Cu}}}, \frac{\#\text{Pt-Cu}}{N_{\text{Pt}}}, \frac{\#\text{Pt-Pt}}{N_{\text{Pt}}}]

where :math:`\#\text{Cu-Cu}` is the number of Cu - Cu nearest neighbors and :math:`N_\text{Cu}` is the total number of Cu atoms in the slab. This check can be performed at two points; either just after candidate creation before evaluation or after evaluation before potential inclusion into the population. We will use the latter method here and add a comparator to the population.

The nearest neighbor average is put in ``candidate.info['key_value_pairs']`` as a string rounded off to two decimal points. *Note* this accuracy is fitting for this size slab, but need testing for other systems.

::

   from ase.ga.utilities import get_nnmat_string

   ...

   # The population instance is changed to
   pop = RankFitnessPopulation(data_connection=db,
                               population_size=pop_size,
                               variable_function=get_comp,
                               comparator=StringComparator('nnmat_string'))

   # Evaluating the starting population is changed to
   while db.get_number_of_unrelaxed_candidates() > 0:
       a = db.get_an_unrelaxed_candidate()
       # The following line is added
       a.info['key_value_pairs']['nnmat_string'] = get_nnmat_string(a, 2, True)
       set_raw_score(a, -get_mixing_energy(a))
       db.add_relaxed_step(a)
   pop.update()
   
   ...

   # If a candidate is not an exact duplicate the nnmat should be calculated
   # and added to the key_value_pairs
   set_raw_score(offspring, -get_mixing_energy(offspring))
   nnmat_string = get_nnmat_string(offspring, 2, True)
   offspring.info['key_value_pairs']['nnmat_string'] = nnmat_string
   offspring.info['key_value_pairs']['atoms_string'] = atoms_string
   new_generation.append(offspring)


Problem specific mutation operators
===================================

Sometimes it is necessary to introduce operators that force the GA to investigate certain areas of the phase space. The :class:`ase.ga.slab_operators.SymmetrySlabPermutation` permutes the atoms in the slab to yield a more symmetric offspring. *Note* this requires `spglib <https://atztogo.github.io/spglib/>`_  to be installed. Try it by::

  from ase.ga.slab_operators import SymmetrySlabPermutation

  oclist = [...
            (1, SymmetrySlabPermutation()),
            ...
           ]


Try to run the algorithm again to see if the number of evaluated structures goes down, but remember that the GA is non-deterministic so in order to compare efficiency of parameters one has to do statistics of many runs. The GA could also be run pool-based instead of generational, try to add each candidate to the database individually as they are evaluated and update the population after each addition, this should lower the total number of evaluations required to determine the convex hull.

Another extension to the tutorial could be to only allow different elements in the top three layers of a thicker slab. This would replicate a surface alloy.
